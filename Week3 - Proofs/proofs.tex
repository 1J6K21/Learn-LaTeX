\section*{Inference}
Rules of Inference deduce new true statements and conclusions from premises.

one standard rule: show premise, show how premises connect, and show how premises connect to conclusion

Modus Ponens - method of approving

Modus Tollens - method of denying

Hypothetical sylloogism - chain together two conditional statements

Disjunctive syllogism - conclude one alternative is true when you know at least one of two things must be true and one of them is false.

Critical Row - $p \to q \:is\:T\:and\:q\:is\:T$

\section*{Definitions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Prime Numbers\\
    A prime integer cannot be factored by an integer that is not itself or one
    \begin{center}    
        if n is prime $\Longleftrightarrow$ $(n>1) \land (\forall r,s \in \mathbb{Z}^+, (n=rs) \to (r=1 \land s=n)\lor(s=1 \land r=n))$
        Thus, a prime integer is greater than one, and is factorized by 2 variables; and for all instances those are 1 and itself.
    \end{center}
    \item Composite Numbers\\
    A composite number is factored by 2 integers that are not 1 and itself
    \begin{center}
        if n is composite $\Longleftrightarrow$ $(n>1)\land (\forall r,s \in \mathbb{Z^+}, (n=rs) \to (1<r<n)\land(1<s<n))$
        Thus, a composite number is facotred by 2 integers that are both $\in$ (1,n)
    \end{center}
    \item Even Numbers
    \begin{center}
    n is even $\Longleftrightarrow$ $\exists k\in\mathbb{Z} | (n = 2k)$\\
    Thus, there exists an integer k that is half of n
    \end{center}
    \item Odd Numbers
    \begin{center}
    n is odd $\Longleftrightarrow$ $\exists k \in \mathbb{Z} | (n=2k+1)$\\
    Thus, there exists a k integer such that it is -1 of an even integer
    \end{center}

    This will be used in proofs later on next week. Remember for exam and homework. Homework needs to be a pdf uploaded.
